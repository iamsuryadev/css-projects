# Simple Login Form using HTML & CSS

This project is my first fully styled webpage component, a login form built to practice fundamental CSS concepts.

## Key Concepts Applied

* **CSS Box Model:** Used to control the layout, spacing, and borders of the form elements.
* **CSS Flexbox:** Implemented to create a responsive layout and center the form on the page.
