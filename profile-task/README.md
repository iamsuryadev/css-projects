# Social Media Profile Card

This is a simple but elegant user profile card, designed to look like something you'd find on a modern social media app. The goal of this project was to practice and combine two powerful CSS concepts: **CSS Positioning** and **Flexbox**.

## Key Techniques Used

* **CSS Positioning:** The main feature of this design is the profile image that "pops out" from the top of the card. This was achieved using `position: relative` on the parent container and `position: absolute` on the image itself, creating a cool, layered effect.

* **CSS Flexbox:** Flexbox was used in two key ways:
    1.  To perfectly center the entire profile card in the middle of the page.
    2.  To neatly arrange and space out the user stats (Posts, Followers, Following) and the buttons at the bottom of the card.

* **Stylish Background:** The page features a vibrant radial gradient background, similar to Instagram's brand colors, to make the profile card stand out.
